  <h1 class="page-heading">Friendly Environment Policy</h1>
  <p>
    The PL Wonks meetings and mailing list aim to encourage the open exchange of ideas through free expression. This requires an environment that enables all to participate without fear of harassment.
  </p>

  <p>
    We specifically define harassment as unwelcome or hostile behavior of an ad hominem nature, i.e., that focuses not on ideas but on people and identity. <a href="https://www.acm.org/special-interest-groups/volunteer-resources/officers-manual/policy-against-discrimination-and-harassment">The ACM's anti-harassment policy</a> lists a variety of specific unacceptable factors and behaviors. A response that the participant was “just joking,” or “teasing,” or being “playful,” will not be accepted.
  </p>

  <p>
    Anyone witnessing or subject to unacceptable behavior should contact a Wonks organizer (Ambrose Bonnaire-Sergeant or Michael Vollmer).
  </p>

  <p>
    If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the Wonks organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from meetings and/or mailing list.
  </p>

    [The wording of this policy is directly derived from that of <a href="http://snapl.org/2015/policy.html">SNAPL</a>, with thanks.]
