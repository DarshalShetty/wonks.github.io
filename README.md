##Contributing

There are two main ways you might contribute.

1. Fork, modify the html files `index.html`, `courses.html`, and `activities.html` with the 
   relevant HTML, and then make a pull request.
2. Add or modify a markdown file under `_posts` in the relevant semester 
   (spring 15 at the time of this writing, called `s15`), preserving the formatting (including
   Jekyll's topmatter) and file naming convention (YYYY-mm-dd-title.md).
