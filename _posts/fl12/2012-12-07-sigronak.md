## Abstract

SIGRONAK: A series of 10- or 15-minute talks on future research or work in
progress and what we hope to accomplish.  This is intended to be an informal
exercise, perhaps tongue-in-cheek at times, to help us formulate and share
research visions.

  * Lindsey Kuper: Using LVars to do 0CFA
  * Cameron Swords: Smarter search strategies for miniKanren
  * Eric Holk: Compiler optimizations for GPUs
  * Edward Amsden : Semantics and implementation of parallel FRP
