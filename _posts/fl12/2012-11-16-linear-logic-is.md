## Abstract

Linear logic is the logic of resources which can neither be created
nor destroyed---or so common wisdom would dictate. But while tensorial
resources are indeed preserved, resources that represent some kind of
choice may still be duplicated or destroyed in certain circumstances.
For example, the type of booleans, 1 + 1, is equivalent (though not
isomorphic!) to the unit type 1, representing "empty truth".

In this talk, I will describe research being done now with Amr Sabry
into a sequent
calculus for a reversible logic that fixes these shortcomings. I will also
discuss a work in progress that involves adding explicit, irreversible
rules into the sequent calculus to get a system that proves the same
theorems as linear logic.
