## Abstract

Scala is a recent "object-functional" programming language that has been growing
in popularity over the last few years. It runs on the JVM and integrates well
with the JVM ecosystem, which makes it a good option in the enterprise world. It
can be written as "Java without as much boilerplate", or as "Haskell that
somehow compiles to Java". This presentation will go over the basics of Scala
syntax, the type system, and then some more advanced type system tricks. The
main focus will be on type classes, though some of what makes Scala a good
language for embedded domain specific languages will also be covered. No
prerequisite knowledge of Scala is required.
