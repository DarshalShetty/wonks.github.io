## Abstract

Array languages have their own unique style of programming and vocabulary that 
can make research and programming with them a strange experience for those who 
are used to purely functional or purely imperative styles of programming. This 
talk will try to demystify some of the key elements that define array languages 
and that separate them from other programming paradigms. Using an example 
based approach, it will attempt to provide a solid foundation for those 
wishing to understand research on array languages or who simply wish to gain a 
better working knowledge of array languages.
