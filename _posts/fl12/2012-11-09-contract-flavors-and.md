## Abstract

Software contracts provide a mechanism for programmers to safely provide
libraries and quickly pinpoint program errors by specifying certain conditions
for variables, function calls, and even lists. A number of features and
extensions have been developed for the field, such as lazy and semi-eager
contracts. Each of these systems contribute a new mechanism for contract
implementation and evaluation, providing a number of unique approaches to
contract enforcement. However, most current contract systems make use of only
one of these systems, providing only those specific advantages and
limitations. This talk will present a hybrid system that hopes to provide
contract writers with enough power to take advantage of each system while
avoiding their limitations.
