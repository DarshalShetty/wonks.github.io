## Abstract

Functional Reactive Programming or FRP is a relatively recent paradigm for expressing
reactive programs. Reactive programs are programs which, rather than computing a single
output from a single input, must react to temporally continuous and discrete inputs and
produce temporally continuous and discrete outputs. Functional Reactive Programming provides
a declarative model for expressing and reasoning about these programs.

This talk will provide an introduction to FRP and its history, discuss the implementation of FRP
and challenges still to be addressed, and describe some example applications which have been 
implemented in FRP.
