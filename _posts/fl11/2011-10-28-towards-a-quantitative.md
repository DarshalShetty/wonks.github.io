## Abstract

Research into the psychology of programming and the underpinnings of software
complexity has been on-going for nearly 50 years. A wealth of quantitative
complexity measures exist for code, but their relationships to the cognitive
processes of the programmer are based largely on out-dated models of the brain
and memory. More modern models of program comprehension exist, but are
effectively qualitative in nature. In this talk, I will give an overview of the
existing "cognitive" models of software complexity (past and present) while
trying to motivate a research program towards developing a modern quantitative
model based on a combination of Computer Science and Cognitive Science.
