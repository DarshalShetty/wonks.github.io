## Abstract

Concepts are a proposed C++ extension for constraints-based polymorphism.
In this paper, we present our experience implementing
an infrastructure for exploring concept designs based on Clang's
an LLVM frontend for the C family of languages. We discuss how
the primary proposed features of concepts (such as concept-based
lookup, overloading and constrained templates) are implemented in
Clang, and how our implementation can be extended to support the
different approaches suggested within the C++ community. Some
illustrations are presented and include a subset of the Boost Graph
Library.
