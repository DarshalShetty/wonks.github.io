## Abstract

While the lambda-calculus and its descendents have dominated
the foundational theories of functional languages, a new family of
calculi has started to gain attention.  These calculi focus on the mu
operator rather than lambda.  This talk presents one such mu-calculus
and shows how it resolves irregularities in the lambda-calculus as
well as provides additional symmetries.  In addition, this mu-calculus
provides a novel perspective on linear logic and intuitions for the
more unusual operators in linear logics.
