## Abstract

The Turing tarpit languages Iota and Jot, while of limited practical use, have a
number of features that make them interesting subjects of study, including their
simplicity and the novel Godel numbering they suggest. I will briefly motivate
Godel numbering and combinatory logic, and describe the SKI combinator basis. I
will then walk through the development of the X combinator, Iota, and Jot, and
describe some of the above properties in more detail. Finally, I will
demonstrate an implementation of Jot in miniKanren, and describe directions of
future work.
