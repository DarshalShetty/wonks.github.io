## Abstract

Behavioral contracts have long been heralded as a transparent mechanism
which can only affect the semantics of programs by detecting contract
violations. This claim persists despite several results going back at least
five years that point out to the "effectful" nature of contracts. Indeed,
in a typical contract system, the predicates embedded in contracts are
sliced and diced and scattered around the program to be enforced or not
depending on various, apparently unrelated, control and data flow
decisions. In addition, practical contract systems allow the contract
writer to execute code and explore data structures that would not have
otherwise been executed or explored. Previous attempts to address this
problem have focused on devising restrictions on contracts to tame their
effects. In this paper, we explore an alternative approach that accepts
current implementations of practical contract systems "as is."
Technically, we design and implement a contract system in which contracts
specify, not just what predicate to check, but also how to check it,
along with a type system that tracks which checks have been performed and
which have been deferred. The system unifies and subsumes various previous
approaches and explains the semantics of realistic contract systems that
employ various strategies for enforcing contracts.
