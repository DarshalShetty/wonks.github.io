## Abstract

A couple years ago, in order to handle scrambling in
Japanese, I introduced a new calculus for the semantic side of CCG
derivations. This simple calculus is easy to describe and it can also
be used to formalize keyword-arguments in programming languages, to
justify notational shorthands in category theory, and numerous other
things I keep stumbling upon. The calculus ties together a number of
disparate threads in theoretical linguistics, type theory, logic, and
category theory; and seems therefore worthy of future study. But one
nagging question is: is it a nice place to do work? Does the calculus
have the properties we usually desire from computational formalisms,
like confluence and strong normalization?

This summer I worked on answering these questions. Some have been
answered in the affirmative. Others remain open, due to limitations in
our usual techniques for solving them--- and perhaps due to
limitations in our understanding of the phenomena in question. This
talk relays some of that exploration.
