## Abstract

(Joint work with Dylan Thurston)

Probabilistic inference is popular in machine learning and cognitive
science, but it is applied much less than it could be because most
inference programs are written from scratch by hand.  Instead,
probabilistic models and inference procedures should be written as
separate reusable modules.  To this end, a promising approach is to
transform clear models to fast inference, using equational reasoning
based on measure semantics and computer algebra.  We show how to
calculate conditional distributions by equational reasoning.  In
particular, we add a `Lebesgue measure' operation to the monadic
representation of stochastic experiments.
