## Abstract

Recently, a new approach has been developed: the use of programming
language techniques for specifying and enforcing end to end
information flow security policies, well known as security-typed
programming languages or language-based information flow security. In
this talk, I will introduce briefly the basic idea of language
based information flow security approach. Next I will present a case
of study in this approach, the restricted delegation and revocation
language (RDRL), a new domain specific security typed programming
language for enforcing information flow policies that varies
dynamically due to delegation among principals or later revocation. The
the design of RDRL will be presented concerning its syntax (illustrated with
some motivating examples) as well as its operational and error
semantics. Moreover the implementation of RDRL using the language 
specification formalism
ASF+SDF will be presented . Finally I will conclude with some 
directions for future work.
