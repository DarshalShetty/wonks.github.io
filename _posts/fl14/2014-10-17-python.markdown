## Abstract

I will discuss Reticulated Python, a system for experimenting with gradual-typed
dialects of Python. It is syntactically identical to Python 3 but gives static
and dynamic semantics to the type annotations already present in Python 3.
Reticulated Python consists of a typechecker and a source-to-source translator
from Reticulated Python to Python 3. Using Reticulated Python, we evaluated a
gradual type system and three approaches to the dynamic semantics of mutable
objects: the traditional semantics based on Siek and Taha (2007) and Herman et
al. (2007) and two new designs. We evaluated these designs in the context of
several third-party Python programs.
