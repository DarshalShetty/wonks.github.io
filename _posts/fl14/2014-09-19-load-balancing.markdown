## Abstract

Topologically aware load balancing (TALB) was originally intended to address the
needs of a few high performance scientific computing researchers in the 80s who
had access to “massively parallel” machines (between 8 and 1024 processors at
the time). Now, with top of the line supercomputers having upwards of 1.5
million nodes and desktop computers quickly gaining cores by the dozens, TALB
has become relevant to a much wider range of applications and users. In this
talk I will present a brief history of the field, the three main classes of
algorithms used, and some of the challenges facing the field. Lastly I will
present some of my ongoing research.
