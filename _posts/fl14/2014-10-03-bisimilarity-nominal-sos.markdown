## Abstract

Structural Operational Semantics (SOS) is one of the most natural ways for
providing programming languages with a formal semantics. In this talk, we focus
on Nominal SOS, a formalization of SOS with explicit syntax and primitives for
the specification of languages with binders, as lambda-calculus and pi-calculus.
In SOS, bisimilarity is typically the most suitable equivalence relation over
programs. We offer a syntactic method for proving that bisimilarity is a
congruence for languages defined in Nominal SOS, i.e. that bisimilarity is
preserved by all the operators of the language being defined. We show the
applicability of the method by recovering classic results, most notably that
Sangiorgiâ€™s open bisimilarity is a congruence for pi-calculus. (Remark: This is
a nearly finished, but unfinished work.)
