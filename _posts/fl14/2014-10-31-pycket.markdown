## Abstract

While object-oriented languages often make use of advanced just-in-time
compilers for fast execution, functional languages typically rely on ahead of
time compilers. Currently, there are no good JIT compilers for the Scheme family
of languages, despite their successful application to other dynamic languages.
In this talk, I will present Pycket; an implementation of Racket in RPython
which makes use of the meta-tracing JIT infrastructure used by the Pypy project.
The goal of Pycket is to provide a fast Racket implementation which can elide
the overhead of traditionally difficult features like continuations, multiple
return values, and Racket's contract system.
