## Abstract

We explore the problem of privilege escalation in web applications,
vulnerabilities that are typically caused by missing or incorrect
authorizations. In the absence of an access control policy specification in
these applications, our key insight is to compute what we call the authorization
state associated with each access request, using program analysis. Checking this
computed state for correctness and consistency across different access requests
helps us uncover vulnerabilities that can be exploited as privilege escalation
attacks. We implement our techniques in MACE, a tool that works on large
codebases, and discovers serious vulnerabilities in 5 out of 7 web applications
that were previously unknown, replacing weeks of human effort and manual code
inspection.
