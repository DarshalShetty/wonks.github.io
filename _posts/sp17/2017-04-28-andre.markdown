## Abstract

In this talk I plan on introducing tactics based theorem proving, sharing some of the technical difficulties (and solutions) that I found, and take a deep dive into a semi-interesting PL proof. People who don't have Coq experience should come for the introduction, and people who are already experienced should come and share yours.
