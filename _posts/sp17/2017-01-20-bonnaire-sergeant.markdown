## Abstract

In this short talk, we will discuss a popular associative data structure:
the Hash Array Mapped Trie.
You will learn the basic ideas behind HAMT's, as well as selected implementation
strategies.
Invented by Bagwell, HAMT's are a popular data structure used by Clojure, Scala,
and via libraries in many other languages.
