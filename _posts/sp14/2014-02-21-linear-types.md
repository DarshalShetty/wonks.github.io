## Abstract

==== Feb. 21: Linear Types: Out of the Ivory Tower and Into the Trenches ====

Speaker: Chris Wailes

Abstract:

Taking software techniques and tools that were developed in an academic setting and making them available and useful to the wider world of software developers can be a difficult task.  This is especially true when one is targeting a language like C++.  In such settings pointers can complicate any analysis that isn't specifically designed to handle them and large bodies of existing code must remain working with little or no modification.  One must also consider the number of false positives that will be generated by the tool or analysis, as well as the effort required by the developer to use it.  Both of these factors can significantly impact the adoption of a potential tool.  This talk will discuss specific issues encountered while developing a linear types analysis for C++.  I will review design decisions that we made and present the system as it currently stands in Clang 3.4.
