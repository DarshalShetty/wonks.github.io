## Abstract

==== Apr. 18: A Few of My Favorite Things: Compilers and APL  ==== 

Speaker: Aaron Hsu

Abstract:

This will be an informal and hopefully fun exploration of array programming and compilation. I hope to tell an entertaining story of my foray into array programming, and give people a feel of what it's
actually like using array programming for "real work"; that is, what it's like using array programming as a general purpose programming language in a domain not usually considered an array programming domain: compilers. I'll cover some of the techniques and thoughts that distinguish array programming at scale from traditional functional programming languages, as well as some of the results of my efforts, including preliminary benchmarks of my APL compiler.
