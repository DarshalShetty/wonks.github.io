## Abstract

This will be an informal and hopefully fun exploration of array programming and
compilation. I hope to tell an entertaining story of my foray into array
programming, and give people a feel of what it's
actually like using array programming for "real work"; that is, what it's like
using array programming as a general purpose programming language in a domain
not usually considered an array programming domain: compilers. I'll cover some
of the techniques and thoughts that distinguish array programming at scale from
traditional functional programming languages, as well as some of the results of
my efforts, including preliminary benchmarks of my APL compiler.
