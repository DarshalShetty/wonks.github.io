## Abstract

==== Feb. 27: Towards a Parallel CSS Selector Matching Algorithm in Harlan ====

Speaker: Eric Holk

Abstract:

Harlan is a new programming language enabling functional programming on GPUs and similar data parallel hardware. Though Harlan has a rich set of features, including first class procedures and algebraic data types, it has not been clear what to do with these things. I will present efforts to implement a parallel CSS selector matching algorithm in Harlan and show how Harlanâ€™s high level features support the development of such an algorithm.
