## Abstract

Harlan is a new programming language enabling functional programming on GPUs and
similar data parallel hardware. Though Harlan has a rich set of features,
including first class procedures and algebraic data types, it has not been clear
what to do with these things. I will present efforts to implement a parallel CSS
selector matching algorithm in Harlan and show how Harlanâ€™s high level
features support the development of such an algorithm.
