## Abstract

Our recent work on using "conservation of information" as a foundational
principle of computation requires a highly symmetrical computational model. In
particular, the type structure of such language includes duals to conventional
sum and product types, the so-called negative and fractional types. Although we
have a reasonable operational understanding of computations involving such
types, previous attempts to find an adequate semantic model have failed. A very
recent investigation shows, however, that the theory of games founded by Conway
in the 70s may have the right ingredients for our desired model. The current
status of this investigation is speculative at best, so this will a rather
informal talk that aims to introduce the basic definitions of our computational
model and of Conway games and argue that there is a good match without providing
any concrete results.
