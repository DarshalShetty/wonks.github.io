## Abstract

==== Mar. 7: Recovering and enhancing miniKanren. ==== 

Speaker: Jason Hemann

Abstract:

miniKanren is a relational programming language designed with purity and portability in mind. Recently, we developed a small language kernel, microKanren , which is somewhat low-level but powerful enough to perform actual relational-programming tasks. We demonstrate here a miniKanren implementation with microKanren as its core, provide some rough performance comparisons, and describe a new implementation of unify.
