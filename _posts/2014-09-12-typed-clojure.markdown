## Abstract

Typed Clojure is an optional type system for Clojure. Typed Clojure is being
used in production systems to help programmers verify, document and design
correct Clojure code. In this talk, we introduce the goals of Typed Clojure and
discuss how effectively Typed Clojure works in practice. We give an overview of
the kinds of problems being solved today with Typed Clojure, and where your
Clojure projects might benefit from a type system like it.
