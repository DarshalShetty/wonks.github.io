## Abstract

Gradual typing semantics are usually given as a translation from a
gradually typed calculus to a statically-typed calculus with casts. In
this work, we extend this to move from a gradually-typed source
language to C with cast support. Along the way, we discuss
efficiency concerns and implementation approaches, explaining our
decisions and how they impact the final product: a compiler for the
gradually-typed lambda calculus (extended with common features).
