## Abstract

Recent work by Bezem, Coquand, and Huber has reformulated the mathematical
underpinnings of HoTT using cubical sets, which is a step towards allowing
a more computational interpretation of HoTT. In this talk I will discuss
how this reformulation of HoTT using cubical sets allows the possibility of
exploration into how we can use this new cubical foundation to provide a
way to talk about what I am calling Directed Homotopy Type Theory, using
directed cubical sets. I will explain some background related to this work
and show how we could use this new theory to encode concurrency at the type
level of the program using the ideas developed by Fajstrup, Raussen, and
Goubalt in their theory on (directed) algebraic topology and concurrency.

This is a forward-looking talk that seeks to motivate research into
Directed Homotopy Type Theory and seeks to show how it could be useful to
other areas of computer science, and programming languages in general.
