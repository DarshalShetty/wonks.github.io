## Abstract

Several conferences, including PLDI and OOPSLA, have added an Artifact
Evaluation process in recent years. The goal is to improve the repeatability and
reusability of computer science research by encouraging authors to submit
artifacts such as source code, proof scripts, videos, etc. to peer review and
ultimately publication. Authors who submit artifacts of sufficient quality are
invited to display a snazzy badge on their paper, and conferences typically
recognize particularly good artifacts at the award ceremony. Although we have
generations of precedent for what makes a good research paper, the artifact
evaluation process is much newer and thus the expectations for a good artifact
are not as clearly understood. I had the opportunity to serve on the Artifact
Evaluation Committee for PLDI 2014 and also to submit an artifact to OOPSLA 2014
which was one of three to earn the Exceeds All Expectations Award. Drawing from
these experiences, I will share some advice for how to prepare high quality
artifacts for future conferences.
