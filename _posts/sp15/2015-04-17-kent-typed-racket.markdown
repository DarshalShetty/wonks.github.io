## Abstract

We are in the process of extending Typed Racket with a practical set
of dependent types. This addition will allow more programs to
typecheck, eliminate more runtime errors, and allow additional
optimizations to be soundly performed. In this informal example-driven
talk I will report on the progress of this extension and demonstrate
how it enables more dynamically typed programs to gradually adopt a
more statically verified specification.
