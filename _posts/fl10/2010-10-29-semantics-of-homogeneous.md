## Abstract

Generative programming techniques allow a range of domain-specific
languages (DSLs) to be homogeneously embedded into richer host languages
by effectively reusing its parser, type checker and compiler. The
interoperability between multiple DSLs is, however, not well-defined and
oftentimes restricted to provide safety guarantees.
We discuss some of the issues faced when trying to compose multiple DSLs
homogeneously embedded using Template Haskell. We finally discuss a
formalization of homogeneous language embeddings called the mu-calculus
which allows parameterisable language embeddings to be specified and
analysed. It facilitates the definition of multiple, expressive language
embeddings in a homogeneous embedding context and shows how to define
polymorphic variant calculi with safety guarantees.
