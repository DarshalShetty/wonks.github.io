## Abstract

Providing useful abstractions requires a formal understanding of what
is being abstracted.  We present a formal semantics for a data
analysis and visualization environment call Stencil.  The semantics
are based on a variant of functional reactive programming.  We then
use the semantics to extend Stencil to include additional useful
elements that difficult to properly implement in an ad-hoc fashion.
