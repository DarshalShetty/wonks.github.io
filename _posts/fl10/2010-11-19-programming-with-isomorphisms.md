## Abstract

I will present a new computational model based on the notion
that computation can be expressed in an information preserving
manner. This appears to be in direct conflict with models like the the
lambda calculus or boolean circuits where basic computation units are
combinators like S and K or NAND and FANOUT that freely duplicate or
drop arguments. Every program expressible in this model is an
isomorphism and it provides a crisp notion of information
preservation. Finally, I will address completeness and talk about the
embedding of a the first-order fragment of the simply-typed lambda-calculus into
this model.
