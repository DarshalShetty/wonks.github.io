## Abstract

DSI is a computational model orginally based on Friedman's and
Wise's "lazy" cons.  It evolved into a model that is demand oriented
(rather than demand driven) and speculative. Eric Jeschke's parallel
implementation of DSI introduced additional ideas of bounded speculation
aiming at architectures that we today call "many-core". My talk will
review this work from the late 1970s to the mid 1990s, some of its
novelties, and problems left open.
