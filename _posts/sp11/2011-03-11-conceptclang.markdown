## Abstract

As I'm heading to an invited talk in Germany next week (at the Institute for
Scientific Computing of Technische Universitï¿½t Dresden) and the next C++
committee meeting in Madrid, Spain in the week after, this talk will basically
review the notion of Concepts in relation to Generic Programming and their
implementation in most programming languages, but in C++ in particular. We will
rehash on the particular design philosophies that led to the overwhelming
removal of Concepts and related features from C++0x, the next scheduled revision
of the language's standard.

I will then be giving an update on my current work on implementing the
feature(s) in the Clang compiler, an LLVM front-end for the C- family of
programming languages (i.e. C, C++, Obj-C, etc...). Although an alpha version of
the implementation has been released this week, it is still in its early stages.
So we will keep implementation-specific talks to a minimal for now... I hope you
can all make it and provide suggestions, or at least take something from the
talk.
