## Abstract

Hygienic macros, nominal logic, and the Barendregt convention all deal with how
to safely deal with names. But what is the connection between these three? As a
first step towards an answer, this talk explores a formalisation of hygiene that
is different than the usual approach. The research here is in its early stages
and discussion and feedback is welcome.
