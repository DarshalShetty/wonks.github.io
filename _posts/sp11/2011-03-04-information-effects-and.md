## Abstract

In this talk I will briefly outline Cartesian Closed
Categories (CCCs) which serve as a model for the Simply Typed
Lambda Calculus and Dagger Compact Closed Categories (DCCCs)
which serve as a model for Quantum Computing. I will then present
a language of isomorphisms where.  It evolved into a model that is demand oriented
(rather than demand driven) and speculative. Eric Jeschke's parallel
implementation of DSI introduced additional ideas of bounded speculation
aiming at architectures that we today call "many-core". My talk will
review this worin computational steps are
information preserving, and then show how adding particular
information effect operators to this language gives us the
structure required for CCCs and DCCCs. The main result presented
here is that well known categorical models emerge from the choice
of information effects, leading us to conjecture that there may
be many of these to be found. By necessity, this talk will be
informal, without dwelling on the details or particular proofs or
translations.
