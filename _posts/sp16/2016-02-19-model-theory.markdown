## Abstract

Model theory has seen a massive rise in popularity in the last decade, with
mathematicians finding novel and useful applications of model theory in algebra
and other fields. In this talk, we'll see what all the fuss is about. I will
provide a basic introduction to model theory, give a big picture explanation of
what it actually means, and talk about some of its applications. 

This talk is intended as a tutorial introduction to model theory, so please show
up ready to join in the conversation.
