## Abstract

PLT Redex is a domain-specific scripting language and tool set designed to
support the conception, design, construction, and testing of semantic systems
such as programming languages, type systems, program logics, and program
analyses. This week I will give an informal tutorial introducing Redex and
briefly describe a few published research projects which have utilized it in
some way.
