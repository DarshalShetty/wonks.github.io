## Abstract

Canonical models of computation, such as Turing machines and lambda calculi,
are one-way roads: their steps cannot be easily undone, or may have a myriad of
individual 'undoings'. Reversible models of computation, however, support
stepping both forward and backward deterministically. This technique had a
number of advantages and applications, from reducing hardware energy cost to
efficient, large-scale parallel computation, to providing new foundations for
mathematical logic. This talk will introduce the theory of reversible
computing, including motivations, core concepts, and applications. In
particular, I will focus on the work happening at Indiana University.
