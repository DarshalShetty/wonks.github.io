## Abstract

I will present version 0.2.0 of Hakaru, Indiana’s very own probabilistic
programming system. Using examples, I will explain the workflow of a typical
Hakaru user, and show the outputs of program transformations. These
transformations are novel in probabilistic computing — if time permits we can
peek into the inner workings of the disintegration transformation. I will keep
statistics to a minimum, explaining necessary details along the way.
