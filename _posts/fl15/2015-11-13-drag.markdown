## Abstract

Drag is a programming language that allows programmers to build ASTs in a
drag-n-drop fashion.

Here we present a minimal and experimental prototype of Drag, which is
implemented on Racket and JavaScript. Out talk is gonna walk through the power
and convenience that comes from Drag, as well as the limitations of Drag
comparing to traditional textual programming languages.
