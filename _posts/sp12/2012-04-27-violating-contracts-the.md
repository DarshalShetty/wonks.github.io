## Abstract

Software contracts provide a mechanism for programmers to safely provide
libraries and quickly pinpoint program errors by specifying certain pre- and
post-conditions for function calls. A number of features and extensions have
been developed for the field, such as lazy and temporal contracts. Each of these
features contributes a new mechanism for contract implementation and evaluation,
providing a number of unique approaches to contract enforcement. In this talk we
introduce and discuss the state of these extensions, demonstrating the
limitations and errors that exist in current implementations. We present the
generally-accepted criterion for effective contract implementations and
demonstrate how each implementation we consider fails to fulfill one of these
requirements.
