## Abstract

There are still many open problems in gradual typing. While there seems to be a
fairly common static semantics the Gradually-Typed Lambda Calculus, there are a
myriad of dynamic semantics all aimed at solving various problems that occur
when you start mixing static and dynamic types. I will talk informally about the
motivations for various dynamic semantics, explain how they relate to and differ
from one another, and talk about open problems with each of them. I will then
introduce the compiler that I am working on for the GTLC and my hopes for what
we may learn from it.
