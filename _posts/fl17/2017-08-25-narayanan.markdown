## Abstract

Probabilistic programming makes machine learning modular by automating a
common component called inference. Recent work by Shan and Ramsey makes
inference itself modular by automating a common component called
conditioning. Their technique, however, is limited to conditioning a
single scalar variable. In this talk we will see how to extend their
algorithm to perform symbolic conditioning on arrays. This is a practice
talk for ICFP, and will touch upon topics in functional programming,
program manipulation, and equational reasoning, with a sprinkling of
Bayesian analysis.
