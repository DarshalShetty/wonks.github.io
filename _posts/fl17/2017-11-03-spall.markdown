## Abstract

Racket provides parallelism via futures, however there are so many caveats that achieving real parallel computation isn't possible in most situations.  In this talk, I will talk about what futures are, the current state of futures in Racket, and how Racket on Chez will hopefully enable users to create actual parallel programs using futures.
