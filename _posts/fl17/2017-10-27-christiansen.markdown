## Abstract

Existing tools for literate programming in Racket, such as scribble/lp2,
focus on a style of literate programming that is very close to Knuth's
original vision, where small slices of programs are explained in the
order that makes sense for a particular narrative, and then assembled
into both documentation and programs. But for for some programs, this is
more of a burden than a help. Felt is another Scribble language that
provides a somewhat different approach to module-oriented multilingual
literate programming for situations where the code itself is the point
of the document.
